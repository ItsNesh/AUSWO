            <p>Completing your studies in Australia is an exciting milestone, and the Temporary Graduate Visa (Subclass 485) offers a valuable pathway to gain work experience and potentially transition to permanent residency. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about making this important transition.</p>

            <h2>What is the Temporary Graduate Visa (Subclass 485)?</h2>
            <p>The Temporary Graduate Visa allows international students who have recently graduated from an Australian educational institution to live, work, and study in Australia temporarily. This visa is designed to help graduates gain practical work experience in their field of study and can serve as a stepping stone toward permanent residency.</p>

            <h2>Two Streams of the Subclass 485 Visa</h2>
            <p>There are two distinct streams available under the Subclass 485 visa:</p>

            <h3>Graduate Work Stream</h3>
            <p>This stream is for graduates with skills and qualifications that relate to an occupation on Australia's skilled occupation list. It allows you to stay in Australia for up to 18 months after graduation. To be eligible, your qualification must be closely related to your nominated occupation, and you'll need a positive skills assessment from the relevant assessing authority.</p>

            <h3>Post-Study Work Stream</h3>
            <p>This stream is available to graduates who hold an eligible higher education degree from an Australian institution. The duration of your visa depends on your qualification level: Bachelor degree holders can stay for two years, Master's degree holders for three years, and Doctoral degree holders for four years. This stream does not require a skills assessment or nomination of an occupation.</p>

            <h2>Eligibility Requirements</h2>
            <p>To be eligible for the Temporary Graduate Visa, you must meet several key requirements. You must have held a valid Student Visa in the six months before applying, and your most recent Student Visa must not have had a condition preventing you from being granted another visa while in Australia.</p>

            <p>You need to have completed at least one eligible qualification as a result of at least two academic years of study in Australia. Your study must have been undertaken while holding a Student Visa, and you must have studied with a registered education provider in Australia. Additionally, you must apply for the visa within six months of completing your course requirements.</p>

            <h2>English Language Requirements</h2>
            <p>Demonstrating competent English is essential for your Subclass 485 application. You can meet this requirement through various English language tests including IELTS, TOEFL iBT, PTE Academic, or Cambridge English Advanced. The required scores are an overall band score of at least 6.0 for IELTS, with no band less than 5.0, or equivalent scores in other accepted tests.</p>

            <p>It's important to note that your English test results must be no more than three years old at the time of your visa application.</p>

            <h2>Health and Character Requirements</h2>
            <p>All applicants must meet Australia's health and character requirements. This involves undergoing a health examination by an approved panel physician and providing police clearance certificates from every country you've lived in for 12 months or more in the past 10 years since turning 16.</p>

            <h2>Application Process and Timeline</h2>
            <p>The application process begins with gathering all necessary documents, including your completion letter from your education provider, academic transcripts, English language test results, and valid passport. You'll need to create an ImmiAccount on the Department of Home Affairs website and complete the online application form.</p>

            <p>After submitting your application and paying the visa fee, you'll be required to undergo health examinations and provide biometrics. Processing times can vary, but most applications are processed within four to five months. During this time, you'll typically be granted a Bridging Visa A, which allows you to remain in Australia lawfully while your application is being processed.</p>

            <h2>Working Rights and Conditions</h2>
            <p>One of the major advantages of the Subclass 485 visa is that it comes with full work rights. You can work full-time or part-time in any field and for any employer in Australia. You're also permitted to study if you choose, though this visa is primarily designed for gaining work experience.</p>

            <h2>What Happens After Your 485 Visa?</h2>
            <p>The Temporary Graduate Visa can serve as an important stepping stone toward permanent residency. During your time on this visa, you can gain valuable Australian work experience, which increases your points for skilled migration pathways. You may also have the opportunity to secure employer sponsorship or meet the requirements for state or territory nomination.</p>

            <p>Many graduates use this time to improve their English language skills, gain additional qualifications, or build professional networks that can support their long-term career goals in Australia.</p>

            <h2>Important Tips for a Successful Application</h2>
            <p>To maximize your chances of success, apply as early as possible within the six-month window after completing your studies. Ensure all your documents are certified and translated if necessary, and double-check that you meet all eligibility requirements before submitting your application.</p>

            <p>Keep records of all your study periods, work experience, and time spent in Australia, as these may be valuable for future visa applications. Consider seeking professional advice if your situation is complex or if you're unsure about any aspect of the application process.</p>

            <h2>Common Pitfalls to Avoid</h2>
            <p>Many applicants encounter issues by missing the six-month application deadline after course completion or failing to maintain their Student Visa conditions before applying. Make sure you don't provide outdated English test results or incomplete documentation, as these are common reasons for visa refusal.</p>

            <p>Always be truthful in your application and provide accurate information. Any false or misleading information can result in visa refusal and may affect your ability to apply for future Australian visas.</p>
