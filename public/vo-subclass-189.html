            <p>The Skilled Independent Visa (Subclass 189) is a points-based permanent residency visa for skilled workers who are not sponsored by an employer, state, or family member. This visa allows you to live, work, and study anywhere in Australia indefinitely.</p>

            <h2>Key Benefits</h2>
            <p>This visa grants you permanent residency from the day it's granted, with no restrictions on where you can live or work in Australia. You can include family members in your application, access Medicare (Australia's public healthcare system), and apply for Australian citizenship after meeting residency requirements. You also have the ability to sponsor eligible relatives for permanent residence and travel to and from Australia for five years from the date the visa is granted.</p>

            <h2>Basic Eligibility Requirements</h2>
            <p>To qualify for the Subclass 189 visa, you must be under 45 years of age at the time of invitation. Your occupation must be on the relevant skilled occupation list, and you need a positive skills assessment for that occupation. You must score at least 65 points on the points test, though competitive scores are typically much higher. Additionally, you need to demonstrate competent English language ability and receive an invitation to apply through SkillSelect.</p>

            <h2>The Points System</h2>
            <p>Points are awarded based on age, with maximum points given to applicants aged 25-32. English language proficiency plays a significant role, with higher points for superior English skills. Your skilled employment experience both in Australia and overseas contributes to your score, as do educational qualifications, with bonus points for Australian study. Partner skills can add points if your spouse or de facto partner also meets certain criteria.</p>

            <p>Additional points are available for other factors such as completing a Professional Year in Australia, having credentials from certain regional institutions, or being proficient in a community language. The current pass mark is 65 points, but in practice, you typically need 85-95 points or higher to receive an invitation due to high competition.</p>

            <h2>Expression of Interest (EOI)</h2>
            <p>The first step in the application process is submitting an Expression of Interest through SkillSelect. This is not a visa application but rather an indication of your interest in migrating to Australia. Your EOI remains valid for two years and can be updated if your circumstances improve. The Department of Home Affairs issues invitations to apply based on points scores, with higher-scoring candidates invited first during regular invitation rounds.</p>

            <h2>Skills Assessment</h2>
            <p>Before submitting your EOI, you must obtain a positive skills assessment from the relevant assessing authority for your occupation. Different occupations have different assessing authorities, such as Engineers Australia for engineering occupations, the Australian Computer Society for ICT professions, or CPA Australia for accounting roles. The assessment verifies that your qualifications and work experience meet Australian standards for your nominated occupation.</p>

            <h2>English Language Requirements</h2>
            <p>You must demonstrate at least competent English, which typically means an IELTS score of at least 6.0 in each component, or equivalent in PTE Academic, TOEFL iBT, or other accepted tests. Higher English scores give you more points, with proficient English requiring IELTS 7.0 in each component and superior English requiring IELTS 8.0 in each component. Your test results must be less than three years old at the time of invitation.</p>

            <h2>Application Process</h2>
            <p>Once you receive an invitation, you have 60 days to submit your complete visa application. You'll need to provide certified copies of identity documents, skills assessment, English test results, and employment evidence including reference letters, payslips, and tax documents. Educational qualifications with academic transcripts, police clearances from all countries where you've lived for 12 months or more, and health examination results are also required. You'll need to pay the visa application charge and complete health and character assessments.</p>

            <h2>Processing Times and Costs</h2>
            <p>Processing times vary but typically range from 8 to 12 months, though some applications may take longer. The base visa application charge is substantial, with additional charges for each family member included in the application. You'll also need to factor in costs for skills assessment, English language tests, health examinations, and police certificates.</p>

            <h2>Health and Character Requirements</h2>
            <p>All applicants must meet health requirements by undergoing examinations by approved panel physicians. You must also satisfy character requirements by providing police certificates and declaring any criminal history. Certain health conditions or character issues may result in visa refusal.</p>

            <h2>Including Family Members</h2>
            <p>You can include your spouse or de facto partner and dependent children in your application. Family members must also meet health and character requirements. If your partner has skills and qualifications, they can contribute points to your application through the partner skills claim.</p>

            <h2>After Your Visa is Granted</h2>
            <p>Once granted, your Subclass 189 visa is permanent. You can live, work, and study anywhere in Australia without restrictions. The initial travel facility on your visa is valid for five years, after which you'll need to apply for a Resident Return Visa if you wish to travel internationally and return to Australia as a permanent resident. After living in Australia for four years as a permanent resident, including 12 months as a permanent resident in the last two years, you may be eligible to apply for Australian citizenship.</p>

            <h2>Tips for a Successful Application</h2>
            <p>Maximize your points score before submitting your EOI by improving your English test scores, gaining additional work experience, or obtaining Australian qualifications. Ensure all documentation is complete, accurate, and properly certified. Keep your EOI updated with any changes to your circumstances that might increase your points. Consider getting professional migration advice if your situation is complex, and be prepared for the process to take time—start planning early and ensure you have sufficient funds for all costs involved.</p>
